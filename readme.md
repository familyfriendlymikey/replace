## What Is This
This is a WIP.

Search and replace patterns in files recursively, previewing matches first, then previewing replacement output, then modifying input files.
It already works but the cli will change.

## TODO
- Take directory arg
- Take file/dir exclusion args
- read .gitignore and .ignore, make sure glob package uses same format
- warn if git dif is not clean
- warn before making changes
- Just cat files
- Maybe, Show context and interactive y/n for each match like fastmod
